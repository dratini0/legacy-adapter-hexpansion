# "Legacy" connector adapter

Adapts the tildagon to various other interfaces.

* Any of the various I2C over JST SH standards (Compatible with Adafruit Stemma QT/Sparkfun Qwiic)
* [Shitty Add-On](https://hackaday.io/project/52950-shitty-add-ons/log/159806-introducing-the-shitty-add-on-v169bis-standard/)
* The expansion connector from TiDAL (hence the name)

Uses the [hexpansion template from EMF](https://github.com/emfcamp/badge-2024-hardware/tree/main/hexpansion).
The footprint for the TiDAL expansion connector is also (unsurprisingly) [borrowed from EMF](https://github.com/emfcamp/TiDAL-Hardware/blob/main/tilda6/tilda6.pretty/XUNPU_FPC-05F-8PH20.kicad_mod).
